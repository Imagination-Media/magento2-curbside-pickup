## Curbside Pickup Module
This Curbside Pickup Module enhances the Buy Online Pick-up In Store (BOPIS) functionality added in the Magento 2.4.1 release.  It will support retailers that use Magento Multi-Source Invenetory (MSI) and those that do not use MSI.  The module allows for modifying the Ready for Pickup notification to include a URL that takes the customer to a simplified UI displaying their order information and allowing them to input their car's make/model/color.  The customer will click this link and enter their information upon arrival at the retailer's physical store.  The entry of this information will trigger a notification to the store that will prompt them to deliver the customer's order to their vehicle at curbside.

Magento 2 module which enables curbside pickup of orders when available for delivery and/or 
scheduled for pick up. The module is made on top of new In Store Delivery method introduced in
Magento 2.4.1 version.
